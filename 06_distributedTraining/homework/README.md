# Homework 6

I had difficulty getting this code to run with more than 2 processes, so above I have only included plots for n=1,2. I don't think the issues I encountered were a problem with my code, but rather some issue with the environment I was running it. It was complaining that some "CUDNN" library could not be found. I am hoping that the above work suffices for this to be marked as complete.
