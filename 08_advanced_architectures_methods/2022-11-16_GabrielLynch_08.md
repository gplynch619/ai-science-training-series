# Homework 8

One problem that has come up in my research that I would like to apply AI to is speeding up Bayesian inference with high dimensional models. Specifically, in my research area of cosmology, one way to do this would be to predict cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra given a set of cosmological parameters using a deep, fully conected neural network. The calculation of the power spectra is often the most computationally expensive part of the inference, and by replacing this calculation with a neural network the hope is that the inference will be more efficient. The training data here would be sets of cosmological parameters and the corresponding CMB power spectra calculated using the exact but slow method we are seeking to replace. A fully connected neural network should be sufficient for the task, as we are seeking to predict an output vector of length rougly 5000, which is relatively modest in size. Success should be measured by how close the predicted power spectra are to the ones exactly computed. Another metric to consider is the speedup gained by using a neural network, since that speedup is what we are actually interested in.
